<h2>About Bouldering</h2>
<p>Because I am more familiar with bouldering, I am going to explain what I like and dislike about it, 
as well as how the rules work so that you can pick up bouldering yourself if you are interested.
The way bouldering works is that there is a set ‘route’ that is identified by the same color
(so a route of yellow holds, or pink holds etc). The objective is to reach the final hold of the route
which is typically marked by a “Final” tag. To begin you need to place BOTH your hands on the hold that
says “begin” that has the same color as the route you are going to attempt. From there it is entirely up
to you to find the best way to make it to the top, and to consider a route completed you grab the final 
hold with both your hands, you can’t get away with just tapping the top or holding it with one hand
(or else you could just jump and tap it quickly, the point is that you reach the top with a solid grip).
There are also a couple of rules, you are not allowed to grap or step on any other color hold apart from your root,
BUT you are allowed to step on the wall (there are some cases where it really helps). That is the basics of how bouldering works,
now I am going to explain how the difficulties are arranged:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Vb, V0: If you see these tags it typically indicates "Beginner" level, and basically anyone can do it that is new to climbing</li>
    <li>V1,V2,V3: These tags are in the beginner range, but there is a considerable curve from V2 to V3, once you reach the V2-V3 range consider yourself a good climber!</li>
    <li>V4,V5,V6: This is when you are entering intermediate level, these are nasty grips, holds and requires some technique past just brute strength</li>
    <li>V7,V8,V9: This is advanced level, at this point you have been climbing for a long time and know what you're doing...</li>
</ul>
