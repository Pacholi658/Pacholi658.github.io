            <h2>Analyzing Celtics Shot Statistics:</h2>
            <img src="plot.jpeg" alt="Shot Frequency Visualization">
            <p>This first visualization is a bar graph representing the amount of missed and made shots by the Celtics as dependent on the distance from the basket. After first understanding the team’s overall shooting percentage, we next wanted to do this analysis to understand what types of shots the Celtics are taking and how effective those more specific types of shots are. On the x-axis of the graph we can see the range aka distance of the shots, and on the y-axis we can see the amount of shots. For each range, there are two bars displayed, the blue bar (false) for missed shots, and the orange bar (true) for made shots. In the visualization we can see that there are 5 different ranges, which are less than 8 feet, 8-16 feet, 16-24 feet, 24+ feet, and back-court shots. As seen in the visualization, we learned from this visualization that the most common types of shots attempted by the Celtics are shots of 24+ feet and shots of less than 8 feet, whereas the other shot ranges are much less frequently attempted. This makes sense because the Celtics are known to be a strong 3-pointer team amongst NBA analysts. Of their two most frequent shot ranges, we can see that the 24+ feet shots have a much larger proportion of missed attempts compared to made attempts, whereas the less than 8 feet shots have a significantly more effective rate where the proportion of made shots is much higher than the proportion of missed shots. We can use this insight to propose that the Celtics, although known for being a 3-point team, might need to slow down a bit on their 3-point attempts and bring some more focus to their less than 8 feet and mid-range shots. This visualization highlights the distribution of shot attempts across different zones on the court. It reveals the Celtics' emphasis on three-point shooting, with a high concentration of attempts from beyond the arc, reflecting their modern offensive strategy.

            <p>
               This visualization shows us a visual representation of the distribution of the Celtics’ missed and made shots around the different locations on the basketball court. On the x-axis we have the x-coordinate of the court and on the y-axis we have the y-coordinate of the court. At face value it contains a lot of data points and doesn’t tell us too much about which locations are effective asides from the fact that shots closest to the basket have a high-efficacy rate; however, when we filter this graph for specific players later on in an interactive visualization, it will be much more insightful to show us a player’s ‘hotspots’ and ‘coldspots.’

        <!-- Visualization 3 -->
        <div class="visualization">
            <img src="plot3.jpeg" alt="Shot Frequency and Success Visualization">
            <p>
                This bar graph helps us compare the number of missed and made shots by players on the Celtic’s roster. On the x-axis are the names of various players on the Celtic’s roster, and on the y-axis is the number of shots. The purpose of this visualization was to give us insight into the Celtic’s offensive distribution strategy, helping us understand which player’s get more ball time and which get less. This can help us understand if the amount of ball time being given to a player is worth it in terms of their efficacy. From the visualization, we can see that Jayson Tatum is by far the player on the team with the most ball time, as he has the highest number of attempted shots. Of his attempted shots, we can see that he has quite a higher proportion of missed shots compared to made shots. In comparison, his runner-up in ball time, Jaylen Brown, has much less attempted shots than Jayson Tatum, but his ratio of missed-to-made shots is almost exactly equal, meaning that although he takes less shots than Tatum, Brown is much more effective with his shots. This proposes the recommendation to make an adjustment to the team’s offensive strategy: reduce some of the attention being given to Tatum and redirect it to Brown, the more efficient shot-taker. By allowing us to compare the efficacy of players in their shot-taking, this bar graph helps us make strategic recommendations towards the team’s offensive strategy.

         <!-- Visualization 4 -->
        <div class="visualization">
            <img src="plot4.jpeg" alt="Shots by quarter">
            <p>
                This visualization is a boxplot that examines the variation in shot distances across different quarters, separated by whether the shot was made or missed. On the x-axis are the quarter numbers, ranging from the first quarter to overtime, and on the y-axis is the shot distance in feet. The red boxplots represent missed shots, while the blue boxplots represent made shots. From this visualization, we observe that the shot distances vary significantly, with missed shots generally having a wider range and higher maximum distances than made shots in each quarter. Additionally, there are notable outliers in each quarter, indicating occasional extreme shot attempts from greater distances. This visualization helps us understand how shot success is correlated with distance and game progression.

        <!-- Visualization 5 -->
        <div class="visualization">
            <img src="plot5.jpeg" alt="Shot type by quarter">
            <p>
                This heatmap visualization explores the relationship between shot type and shot outcome. The two shot types analyzed are 2-point field goals and 3-point field goals, displayed along the y-axis, while the shot outcomes—“Missed” and “Made”—are shown on the x-axis. Each cell is color-coded to represent the frequency of shots, with a gradient from blue (low frequency) to red (high frequency). For example, 2-point field goals that are made appear in the deep red region, signifying high frequency. This visualization highlights the Celtics’ shot trends, showing that missed 3-point shots are nearly as frequent as missed 2-point shots, reflecting the team’s strong reliance on long-range shooting. By emphasizing shot success rates across both types, this visualization provides a clearer picture of the team’s scoring efficiency.
