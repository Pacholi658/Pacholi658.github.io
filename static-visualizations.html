            <p>
                This bar graph represents the amount of missed and made shots by the Celtics as dependent on the distance from the basket. After first understanding the team’s overall shooting percentage, we next wanted to analyze what types of shots the Celtics are taking and how effective those specific types of shots are. This visualization highlights the Celtics' emphasis on three-point shooting, with a high concentration of attempts from beyond the arc, reflecting their modern offensive strategy.

            <p>
                This boxplot examines the variation in shot distances across different quarters, separated by whether the shot was made or missed. The red boxplots represent missed shots, while the blue boxplots represent made shots. This visualization helps us understand how shot success is correlated with distance and game progression.
